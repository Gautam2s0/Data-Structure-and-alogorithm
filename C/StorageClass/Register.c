// This storage class declares register variables that have the same functionality as that of the auto variables
//The only difference is that the compiler tries to store these variables in the register of the microprocessor if a free register is available.

//Use of register variables to be much faster than that of the variables stored in the memory during the runtime of the program.


// If a free registration is not available, these are then stored in the memory only.

// We are using register class where variable which are frequently use in progaram and improve the running time of program.

// We cannot obtain the address of a register variable using pointers. 

// Scope of register class variable is block/function
